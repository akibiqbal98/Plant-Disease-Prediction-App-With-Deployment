# Plant Disease Prediction App

In this project, I will create a convolutional neural network that will
be able to predict whether the plant is suffering from a disease or not.I will be using different layers and other hyper parameters for building,
cleaning, and testing this classification model.
	1) tensorflow
	2) Keras


### WHY:
Human society needs to increase food production by and estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an explected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people.
Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%.
The widespread distribution of smartphone among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of tuening the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food.
One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through Machine Learning and Big Data.
  
  
The steps to solve the problem :
	1) Mounting google drive on collab notebook
	2) Visualizing the image that we will be working on
	3) Finiding out the mean of the dimensions and resizing all image accordingly
	4) Converting the images into a numpy array and normalize them 
	5) checking class imbalance
	6) Splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding
	7) Creating the midel architecture, compiling the model and then fitting it.
	8) Plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch
	9) Preprocessing the test data and make predictions on it.
	10) Visualizing the orginal and predicted labels for the test images.
